## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse matrix
## get the value of the inverse matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inv) m <<- inv
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Solves the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse matrix has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse matrix from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it solves the matrix and sets the value of the inverse matrix in the cache via the setinverse function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
